# GPS-to-MQTT

## Overview

This Rust project serves as a bridge between GPS hardware and MQTT-based systems, enabling real-time GPS data integration into IoT and telemetry applications. It reads NMEA-0183 format data from USB GPS dongles, processes the various sentence types, and publishes parsed information to configurable MQTT topics.

### Key Capabilities

- **GPS Data Processing**: Reads and parses standard NMEA-0183 sentences including position, speed, course, and satellite information
- **Real-time MQTT Publishing**: Converts GPS data into structured MQTT messages with configurable topics and QoS levels
- **High-Frequency Updates**: Optional support for 10Hz update rates on compatible u-blox GPS modules
- **Flexible Configuration**: TOML-based configuration for serial port settings, MQTT broker details, and topic customization

### Hardware Compatibility

While the software supports standard NMEA-0183 protocols, it has been primarily tested with the TOPGNSS GN800G GPS module (M8030-KT chipset). The 10Hz high-frequency mode specifically targets u-blox compatible devices. Users should exercise caution when using untested GPS hardware. Use it at your own risk!

### Use Cases

- Vehicle tracking systems
- Fleet management solutions
- IoT data collection
- Navigation applications
- Telemetry systems integration

> **Note**: This is an ongoing development project. While functional, it may require adjustments for specific use cases or hardware configurations. Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve compatibility and features.

## Features

- üì° Reads NMEA-0183 GPS data from USB GPS dongles
- üîÑ Support for 10Hz GPS update rate (u-blox devices only)
- üõ∞Ô∏è Parses multiple NMEA sentence types:
  - GSV (Satellites in View)
  - GGA (Fix Information)
  - RMC (Recommended Minimum Data)
  - VTG (Track & Speed)
  - GSA (Overall Satellite Data)
  - GLL (Geographic Position)
  - TXT (Text Transmission)
- üìä Publishes parsed data to MQTT topics

### 10Hz Mode Toggle

There is a toggle that switches the dongle to 10Hz mode, which might be dangerous on other devices. Use this feature at your own risk. Binary commands with u-blox undocumented commands are pushed to the device for this operation.

## Build Instructions

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gps-to-mqtt.git
    ```

3. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd gps-to-mqtt
    ```

4. Copy the [example.settings.toml] file to [settings.toml] in the same directory as the executable. Modify [settings.toml] as needed for your configuration:

    ```bash
    cp example.settings.toml settings.toml
    ```

5. Build the project in release mode:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

6. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./target/release/gps-to-mqtt
    ```

## Project Structure

- `src/config.rs`: Module for loading project configuration.
- `src/gps_data_parser.rs`: Module containing the main logic for parsing GPS data.
- `src/mqtt_handler.rs`: Module for setting up MQTT and publishing messages.
- `src/serial_port_handler.rs`: Module for setting up and reading from the serial port.
- `src/main.rs`: Entry point for the application.

## MQTT Data Format

MQTT data is stored under the configured base topic (default: `/GOLF86/GPS/`) using 3-letter codes as subtopics.

### Core GPS Data
- `CRS` - Course/heading in degrees (0-359¬∞)
- `TME` - GMT time in HH:MM:SS format
- `DTE` - Date in dd.mm.YYYY format
- `LAT` - Latitude in decimal degrees (¬±90¬∞)
- `LNG` - Longitude in decimal degrees (¬±180¬∞)
- `SPD` - Ground speed in km/h
- `ALT` - Altitude in meters above sea level
- `QTY` - GPS fix quality (0=invalid, 1=GPS fix, 2=DGPS fix)

### Additional Speed Formats
- `SPD_KTS` - Speed in knots
- `SPD_KPH` - Speed in kilometers per hour

### Satellite Information
- `SAT/GLOBAL/NUM` - Total number of satellites in view
- `SAT/GLOBAL/ANTSTATUS` - Antenna status
- `SAT/GLOBAL/PF` - Position fix status
- `SAT/GLOBAL/GNSS_OTP` - GNSS chip configuration

### Per-Satellite Data
Under `SAT/VEHICLES/{PRN}/` where PRN is the satellite ID:
- `FIX_TYPE` - Fix type (Not Available, 2D, 3D)
- Full satellite info string containing:
  - PRN number
  - Satellite type (GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/BeiDou)
  - Elevation angle
  - Azimuth angle
  - SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
  - In View status

### Geographic Position (GLL specific)
- `GLL_TME` - Time from GLL sentence
- `GLL_LAT` - Latitude from GLL sentence
- `GLL_LNG` - Longitude from GLL sentence

## Pre-Built Packages

There are also pre build packages (outdated), that combines three individual components: [Speeduino-to-MQTT](https://github.com/askrejans/speeduino-to-mqtt), [GPS-to-MQTT](https://github.com/askrejans/gps-to-mqtt), and [G86 Web Dashboard](https://github.com/askrejans/G86-web-dashboard) in one system with predefined services.

You can quickly get started by using pre-built packages available for both x64 and Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM) architectures:

- **DEB Packages for x64:** [Download here](https://akelaops.com/repo/deb/pool/main/amd64/g86-car-telemetry_1.0.deb)
- **DEB Packages for Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM):** [Download here](https://akelaops.com/repo/deb/pool/main/aarch64/g86-car-telemetry_1.0.deb)
- **RPM Packages for x64:** [Download here](https://akelaops.com/repo/rpm/x86_64/g86-car-telemetry-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm)
- **RPM Packages for Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM):** [Download here](https://akelaops.com/repo/rpm/aarch64/g86-car-telemetry-1.0-1.aarch64.rpm)

### Package Installation Details

- All packages install the three services in the directory `/opt/g86-car-telemetry` (or `/usr/opt/g86-car-telemetry`).
- Configuration files for GPS and ECU processors can be found under `/etc/g86-car-telemetry` (or `/usr/etc/g86-car-telemetry`).
- Web project configurations are located in `/var/www/g86-car-telemetry/config` (or `/usr/var/www/g86-car-telemetry/config`).
- Ensure to add relevant configurations for MQTT server, TTY ports, and any extra settings.

### Installed Services

The packages automatically install and manage the following services:

- `g86-car-telemetry-gps`
- `g86-car-telemetry-speeduino`
- `g86-car-telemetry-web`

### Compatibility and Testing

These packages have been tested on both Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM) with DEB packages and x86 systems with RPM packages. However, please note that this project is a work in progress, and more tests are needed, especially with real ECUs. Exercise caution when using, and stay tuned for updates as development continues to enhance and stabilize the functionality.
